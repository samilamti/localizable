<p>
    <b>Thank you</b> for offering your translation services to us! Before we get started, however, we would love to know a <em>little</em> bit
    about who we are dealing with. Don't worry though! The process is very simple and only involves logging in with any of our partners below. We
    need to know this for two reasons:
    <ol>
        <li/>First off, we belive that the translations in question will be better, if there is a tie-in to a real person.
        <li/>Second off, we want to give you credit for your translations when they are used! Whenever your translation is used, your name
        will be published, whether it is used to produce an awesome app or a web site. That is, unless you explicitly tells us not to.
    </ol>
