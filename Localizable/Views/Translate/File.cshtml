    For best results, it is <b>strongly recommended</b> that you upload a file where the neutral language is English. To enable as many people as possible to contribute
    to the site, our goal has been to translate from English to all other languages.

    <h3>What's going to happen?</h3>
    First off, we will upload the file to our servers. Then, we will run all your keys through our translation engine,
    substituting your values for localized values in each language we have available. Finally, we will return a suitable
    set of files in a .zip archive for you to download. You can then import the files in your development environment.
    
    <h3>What if you don't have translations for all my keys?</h3>
    If we lack translations, we will add a comment - <b>needs translation</b> to your key and type in the default value
    you provided in your upload. To make this process better, you can help us by uploading already translated resource
    files, which we can use to help others.
